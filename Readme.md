# IMAPtool

Apple Mail seems to be a bit buggy, so I've written a little python script 
to backup and delete duplicate messages from an IMAP account. 

**Note:** This is an experimental software. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

Edit your account information in Account.py. Set ssl=True if you use an
SSL connection (this should be standard). Then run ```python IMAPtool.py```.
